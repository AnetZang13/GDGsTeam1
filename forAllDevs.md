Hi Annie, An, Susan, and Nancy!
It's Annette: this is a test run of connecting server-side with front-end

The steps I took to create this:
    First through Terminal(should be mostly similar on Windows):
        1. I had node, npm, and git installed
        2. I created my own branch in github (annette_dev)
        3. I cloned the current repo (named GDGsTeam1)
        4. I navigated to the current repo via terminal 
                (For me: cd /Users/azhang/GDGsTeam1) 
        5. npm init -y
        6. npm install express
        7. npm install mysql
        8. npm install dotenv
        9. touch server.js
    then with VSCode (with the repo FOLDER opened):
        1. Added suggested code to server.js to set up local port 
        2. Created 'public' folder
        3. Moved index.html and main.css into 'public'
        4. Created 'backend' folder
        5. Moved server.js, package.json, and package-lock.json into 'backend'
        6. Left the official README.md at the root
        7. Added notes for specific devs 
That's all!
(You're not meant to recreate the steps above, but they're there if you want to learn how I did it! )
